#  DSA - Hashing Practice (C++)

This repository contains a collection of problems solved using **Hashing** techniques in C++.  
Hashing helps in solving many problems efficiently by reducing time complexity to O(1) for lookups.



##  Topics Covered

- Frequency Count of Characters/Numbers
- Count Subarrays with Given Sum (Prefix Sum + HashMap)
- Longest Subarray with Given Sum
- Check for Anagrams (Using HashMap)
- Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- HashMap vs Unordered_Map
- Use of `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`
- Prefix Sum with Hashing
- Application of Hashing in Strings and Arrays



## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open the `.cpp` file in any C++ IDE (like VS Code).
3. Compile and run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
 Why Hashing?
Hashing is a powerful tool in solving:

Subarray/Substring problems

Frequency-based questions

Set-based logic
Used in interviews for companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Capgemini, and HCL.
